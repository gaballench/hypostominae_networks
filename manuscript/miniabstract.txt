Phylogenetic networks explain topological conflict and taxonomic complexity in Neotropical Armored Catfishes (Siluriformes: Lorcariidae: Hypostominae)

Strictly-bifuracating trees have long been the standard representation of evolutionary relationships. However, they do not account for reticulating patterns which are a result of hybridisation, making a daughter lineage to inherit genetic material from different lineages instead of a single parental species. One consequence is that phylogenetic methods for reconstruction of trees do not account for these non-bifurcating event and thus need to enforce a strictly-bifurcating pattern, often interpreting hybridisation signal in the data as noise, conflict, or uncertainty. Such topological conflicts cannot be solved by including more data, such as in phylogenomic analyses with thousands of loci. Here we use SNaQ, a pseudo-likelihood method for fast estimation of phylogenetic networks in order to infer hybridisations events in the Hypostominae, a complex group of Neotropical Armored Catfishes with a complex taxonomic and phylogenetic history. We used data from Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs) as the input for estimating the topology under the assumption that hybridisations can take place, and relate these events to well-documented cases of topological conflict and taxonomic complexity highlighted in previous studies. We found that Micracanthicus, a montypic genus is the result of a well-supported hybridisation event between the genus Hypancistrus and a clade including species of Hypostomus. Also, the genus Hypostomus was found to show several additional hybridisation events, which might explain why it has long been challenging to disentangle its taxonomy. Uncertainty in network estimation is discussed and suggestions provided for exploring hybridisation events in other diverse Neotropical fish groups.
